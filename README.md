## About
This [Image Gallery App](https://react-image-gallery-app.netlify.app/) is an example of how to integrate [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Using [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/), images are obtained from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and displayed. The app also gives you the feature of searching for images according to different terms. 

The API returns back various images related to that term. If no term is provided, it gives you a set of random pictures. Each photo has detailed information about the user who posted the image, number of views, number of downloads, and likes. 

__Technologies Used__
- [_React.js_](https://reactjs.org/) 
- [_Tailwind CSS (For styling)_](https://tailwindcss.com/)
